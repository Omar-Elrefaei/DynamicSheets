# DynamicSheets
A minimal CLI spreadsheet program

DynamicSheets allow you to import hundreds of rows & columns where you can *sort* and *search* them.

After you are done manuplating and inspecting your data, you can export to a user friendly `txt` file that can be imported into `DynamicSheets` later.
